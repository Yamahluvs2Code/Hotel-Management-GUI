# Hotel-Management
Class names are in french. Sorry :( 


As the name states tis GUI is made for managing clients in a hotel. Within the JmenuBar() of the main window
the user has the choice to either add, modify or cancel a reservation, check availability, search for a clients info or 
complete a customer checkout. Regardless of choice the user makes a new window will pop up 
allowing them to complete their task.

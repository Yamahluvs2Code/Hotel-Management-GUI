Class names are in french. Sorry :(

the hotel management system. Within the JmenuBar() the user has the choice to either 
add, modify or cancel a reservation, check availability, search for a clients info or 
complete a customer checkout. Regardless of choice the user makes a new window will pop up 
allowing them to complete their need.
